6. Write a short summary (max. 150 words) explaining the differences between these techniques and when each one is most
appropriate.

merge: takes history of both branches and combines them, keeping all commits saved
squash: takes all the commits which were made on the secondary branch, 
  groups them together in a single commit and sends it to targeted branch
rebase and merge: takes all commits that were made on the secondary branch and repeats them on main, 
  making it appear as if the changes were always made on main/master
